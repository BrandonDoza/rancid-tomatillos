## 📚 Context


## 🏆 Wins
-This project was our first project using React.
-We had daily stand-ups in our group, which allowed us to complete the project while learning new material.
-Although the material and technologies used were new to us, this project deepened our understanding of those technologies and increased our confidence in using them. 

## 🚧 Challenges
-When first using React Router, refactoring from conditional rendering to Router was a little confusing (but we figured it out).
-Creating the responsive layout for the first time was a lot of trial and error.
