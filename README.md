## üåü Overview
This project used React (and other technologies listed above) to create a web application that allows users to view a list of popular movies. They can see an overview of all moives at once, and click on any of the individual movie cards to view more detailed information about that particular movie. 

## ‚ú® Features
This project utilized RESTful architecture, and Responsive Layout design. These were implemented for the best possible user experience. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Tests
We tested this application using Cypress E2E testing for the first time. 
To view tests:
* npm run cypress open

## üèÜ Wins
* This project was our first project using React.
* We had daily stand-ups in our group, which allowed us to complete the project while learning new material.
* Although the material and technologies used were new to us, this project deepened our understanding of those technologies and increased our confidence in using them. 

## üöß Challenges
* When first using React Router, refactoring from conditional rendering to Router was a little confusing (but we figured it out).
* Creating the responsive layout for the first time was a lot of trial and error.
